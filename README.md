**Analysis of Race/ethnicity and Socioeconomic Factors and Tooth Decay among US Children**

**Objective**: To measure racial/ethnic disparities in the risk of developing tooth decay and quantify relative contributions of factors mediating the observed disparities among US children. 

**Design, setting and participants**: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records of US children (2014-2020) to measure racial/ethnic disparities in the risk of tooth decay. An Anderson-Gill model, a time-to-event model for recurrent tooth decay events with time-varying covariates, stratified by age groups (0-5, 6-10,11-18 years) was estimated. Elastic net regularization was used to select predictors to be included in the model among medical conditions, dental procedure types, and individual- and community-level socioeconomic factors. A nonlinear multiple additive regression tree-based mediation analysis quantified the relative contributions of factors underlying the observed racial/ethnic disparities.

**Exposures**: Race/ethnicity of children 

**Main Outcomes and Measures**: Diagnosis of tooth decay in either deciduous or permanent teeth, defined as at least one decayed, filled, or missing tooth due to caries.

**Results**: Among 61,083 children between age 0 and 18 at baseline (mean [SD] age, 9.9 (4.6)), 2,654  Black [4.3%], 11,213 Hispanic [18.4%], 42,815  White [70.1%] and 4,401 Other race [7.2%] patients were identified. Larger racial/ethnic disparities were observed among those aged 0-5 years compared to other age groups with adjusted hazard ratios [HR]s of 1.47 (95%CI:1.40,1.54), 1.30 (95%CI:1.19,1.42), and 1.39 (95%CI:1.29,1.49) for Hispanic,  Black, and Other race groups, respectively, relative to White children. For those aged 11-18 years, a higher risk of tooth decay (HR =1.17; 95%CI:1.06,1.30) was observed only in Black adolescents. A mediation analysis revealed that the influence of race/ethnicity on time to first tooth decay became negligible, except for Hispanic and children of Other race aged 0-5, suggesting that mediators explained most of the observed disparities. Insurance type explained the largest proportion of the disparity, ranging from 31.1% (95%CI:25.0,38.5) to 59.0% (95%CI:43.5,75.5), followed by dental procedures (receipt of topical fluoride and restorative procedures) and community-level factors (education attainment and Area Deprivation Index). 

**Conclusions**: In this retrospective cohort study, large proportions of racial/ethnic disparities in time to first tooth decay were explained by insurance type and dental procedure types among children/adolescents. These findings can be applied to develop targeted strategies to reduce oral health disparities.
